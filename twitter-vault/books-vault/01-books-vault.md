[Money Trap & Masa Son's Bio](https://x.com/1shankarsharma/status/1881625679428464849)

Just finished reading Masa Son's bio by @lionelbarber. Good read.
Also read @alok_sama's Money Trap, on his times with Masa. A Liar's Poker style book, well written, even though I had to reach  for my dictionary more than once & I have decent vocab!
Masa comes across as a Tukka - fluke King. Throw a lot of money ( @ near 0 rates too) at futuristic ideas. Some will work. And it is no big deal to evangelize , ie,  " Vision" about EVs, AI, Solar etc.
We have known these themes for 50 years and at some point some will indeed become real, as they have now.
Overall, both excellent reads.
