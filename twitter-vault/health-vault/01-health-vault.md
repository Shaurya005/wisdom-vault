Not everyone needs to add salt to their water.

Electrolyte drinks are useful—but mostly for people who are:

Working out intensely & sweating a lot

Fasting for long hours (like intermittent fasting)

Dealing with dehydration (due to illness or heat)

If your day looks like laptop–chai–Netflix, plain water works just fine!

loosely translated

“If son/daughter is competent then why save money (can earn themselves), if they are incompetent then why save money (will waste)”.
