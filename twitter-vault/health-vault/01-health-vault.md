Not everyone needs to add salt to their water.

Electrolyte drinks are useful—but mostly for people who are:

Working out intensely & sweating a lot

Fasting for long hours (like intermittent fasting)

Dealing with dehydration (due to illness or heat)

If your day looks like laptop–chai–Netflix, plain water works just fine!

- Whey protein isolate
- Creatine monohydrate
- Black coffee
