[Electrolyte Water](https://x.com/priya_nagwani/status/1912546921362636909)

Not everyone needs to add salt to their water.

Electrolyte drinks are useful‚Äîbut mostly for people who are:

Working out intensely & sweating a lot

Fasting for long hours (like intermittent fasting)

Dealing with dehydration (due to illness or heat)

If your day looks like laptop‚Äìchai‚ÄìNetflix, plain water works just fine!






‚ÄúPoot Sapoot to kyu dhan sanchay, poot kapoot to kyu dhan sanchay‚Äù

loosely translated

‚ÄúIf son/daughter is competent then why save money (can earn themselves), if they are incompetent then why save money (will waste)‚Äù.

[Only Supplement](https://x.com/theliverdr/status/1934227797599555620)

I think these are the ONLY nutritional supplements worth your time and money (in their recommended situations):

- Whey protein isolate
- Creatine monohydrate
- Black coffee

[Physical activity](https://x.com/drwilliamwallac/status/1951984429359845434)

Physical activity is the most effective intervention available for promoting brain health and longevity. Recent research demonstrates that regular exercise, even in modest amounts, is effective for enhancing brain volume, improving memory, and reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Beyond its cognitive benefits, moderate physical activity also contributes to extended lifespan and better overall health outcomes.

Even regular walking has shown to have powerful impacts on brain structure and function:

*Ô∏è‚É£Activity levels equivalent to 4,000 steps per day have been linked to measurable increases in gray matter and white matter volumes (PMID: 38073389)

*Ô∏è‚É£A 2011 study showed that 40 minutes of walking, three times per week lead to a 2% increase in hippocampal volume over one year, effectively reversing 1‚Äì2 years of age-related atrophy and enhancing spatial memory performance (PMID: 21282661).

*Ô∏è‚É£A more recent study suggests that activity levels equivalent to walking just under 3 hours daily for the least active populations could extend lifespan by 11 years on average (doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2024-108125).

Even walking is an accessible, non-pharmacological intervention for promoting brain health, reducing disease risk, and enhancing longevity.
