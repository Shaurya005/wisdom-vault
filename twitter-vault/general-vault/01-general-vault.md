## [Shankar Sharma's Gurus](https://x.com/1shankarsharma/status/1943318848272261630)

I have admired, even revered üôè, just 3 people in life: Imran Khan, Muhammad Ali, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Business people & Investors are largely mediocre : one hit product, 1-2 lucky stock picks that made a lot of money. Almost no skill. Largely luck.
But sports? All skill.
My Gurus, as above, have had multiple acts: Immy: greatest all rounder after Sobers, philanthropist via Cancer hospital, politician; Ali: biggest comeback artist ever, after fighting US govt, winning back his crown in boxing old age.
Arnie: greatest bodybuilder ever. Superstar. Politician.

These are my Gurus. They have skill. Almost no enduring luck.
Baki sab tukka kings.

## [Happiness and Focus](https://x.com/JEverettLearned/status/1940952313398808609)

Happiness is highly linked to how focused you are on what you're doing.

A wandering mind is an unhappy mind.

## [What you want](https://x.com/thedankoe/status/1940098937521922213)

Life is hard because you don't know what you want. That's 90% of the battle. Once you have extreme clarity on what you want, after 5-10 calculated risks, everything else is quite simple. If you can reach that before you turn 25, you're in the top 1%.

Fast, lift, sprint, stretch, and meditate.

Build, sell, write, create, invest, and own.

Read, reflect, love, seek truth, and ignore society.

Make these habits. Say no to everything else.

Avoid debt, jail, addiction, disgrace, shortcuts, and media.

Relax. Victory is assured.

## [The Art of Business Wars](https://x.com/Iamsamirarora/status/1880894226835337242)

Finished "The Art of Business Wars"- If you want to read stories about different businesses/companies in an easy to read format, sorted by topics.

It is OhhK.

## [Money Trap & Masa Son's Bio](https://x.com/1shankarsharma/status/1881625679428464849)

Just finished reading Masa Son's bio by @lionelbarber. Good read.
Also read @alok_sama's Money Trap, on his times with Masa. A Liar's Poker style book, well written, even though I had to reach  for my dictionary more than once & I have decent vocab!
Masa comes across as a Tukka - fluke King. Throw a lot of money ( @ near 0 rates too) at futuristic ideas. Some will work. And it is no big deal to evangelize , ie,  " Vision" about EVs, AI, Solar etc.
We have known these themes for 50 years and at some point some will indeed become real, as they have now.
Overall, both excellent reads.


## [Choose Your Problem](https://x.com/tightvcptrader/status/1966719085170868538)

9‚Äì5 feels suffocating, freelancing feels unstable.

Single feels empty, relationships feel heavy.

Money problems are hard, managing wealth is harder.

Life is just trade-offs.

Choose the set of problems you can live with.

## [Separate From Distraction](https://x.com/MarketScientist/status/1966338133672505459)

## [Time Spent Graph](https://x.com/connectgurmeet/status/1965958125657403608)

A friend shared this and it really got me thinking

1. In our teens, we spend max time with family & friends
2. In 30s and 40s, coworkers & children
3. mid-life, our life partner
4. Towards the end there‚Äôs a sharp rise in time spent alone.

When u finally have money, assets - u r alone!

Don't ignore friends n family . That blue n green line should remain steady !!

## [Big Filters of Life](https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/1965536032121913571)

the big filters:

- what you put in your body (food)
- what you put in your mind (media/social media)
- who you spend time with (friends)
- what you choose to give a f*ck about (what you let bother you)
- 
```
A better life starts with a better filter. Change who and what you allow into your world, and the peace will follow.

Fake news as usual. Better summary of what I actually said:
