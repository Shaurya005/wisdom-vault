## [Shankar Sharma's Gurus](https://x.com/1shankarsharma/status/1943318848272261630)

I have admired, even revered 🙏, just 3 people in life: Imran Khan, Muhammad Ali, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Business people & Investors are largely mediocre : one hit product, 1-2 lucky stock picks that made a lot of money. Almost no skill. Largely luck.
But sports? All skill.
My Gurus, as above, have had multiple acts: Immy: greatest all rounder after Sobers, philanthropist via Cancer hospital, politician; Ali: biggest comeback artist ever, after fighting US govt, winning back his crown in boxing old age.
Arnie: greatest bodybuilder ever. Superstar. Politician.

These are my Gurus. They have skill. Almost no enduring luck.
Baki sab tukka kings.

## [Happiness and Focus](https://x.com/JEverettLearned/status/1940952313398808609)

Happiness is highly linked to how focused you are on what you're doing.

A wandering mind is an unhappy mind.

## [What you want](https://x.com/thedankoe/status/1940098937521922213)

Life is hard because you don't know what you want. That's 90% of the battle. Once you have extreme clarity on what you want, after 5-10 calculated risks, everything else is quite simple. If you can reach that before you turn 25, you're in the top 1%.

## [Naval's Advise](https://x.com/naval/status/1254177712945500160)

Fast, lift, sprint, stretch, and meditate.

Build, sell, write, create, invest, and own.

Read, reflect, love, seek truth, and ignore society.

Make these habits. Say no to everything else.

Avoid debt, jail, addiction, disgrace, shortcuts, and media.

Relax. Victory is assured.


## [Last Longer](https://x.com/UmarAshraf/status/1957109481923371114)

One of the best pieces of advice.

## [The Art of Business Wars](https://x.com/Iamsamirarora/status/1880894226835337242)

Finished "The Art of Business Wars"- If you want to read stories about different businesses/companies in an easy to read format, sorted by topics.

It is OhhK.

## [Money Trap & Masa Son's Bio](https://x.com/1shankarsharma/status/1881625679428464849)

Just finished reading Masa Son's bio by @lionelbarber. Good read.
Also read @alok_sama's Money Trap, on his times with Masa. A Liar's Poker style book, well written, even though I had to reach  for my dictionary more than once & I have decent vocab!
Masa comes across as a Tukka - fluke King. Throw a lot of money ( @ near 0 rates too) at futuristic ideas. Some will work. And it is no big deal to evangelize , ie,  " Vision" about EVs, AI, Solar etc.
We have known these themes for 50 years and at some point some will indeed become real, as they have now.
Overall, both excellent reads.


## [Choose Your Problem](https://x.com/tightvcptrader/status/1966719085170868538)

9–5 feels suffocating, freelancing feels unstable.

Single feels empty, relationships feel heavy.

Money problems are hard, managing wealth is harder.

Life is just trade-offs.

Choose the set of problems you can live with.

## [Separate From Distraction](https://x.com/MarketScientist/status/1966338133672505459)

Frame this quote in your mind as soon as possible 😇

This is one of my all time favourite quote & learning in life..

Gratitude 🙏

## [Time Spent Graph](https://x.com/connectgurmeet/status/1965958125657403608)

A friend shared this and it really got me thinking

1. In our teens, we spend max time with family & friends
2. In 30s and 40s, coworkers & children
3. mid-life, our life partner
4. Towards the end there’s a sharp rise in time spent alone.

When u finally have money, assets - u r alone!

Don't ignore friends n family . That blue n green line should remain steady !!

## [Big Filters of Life](https://x.com/ShaanVP/status/1965536032121913571)

the big filters:

- what you put in your body (food)
- what you put in your mind (media/social media)
- who you spend time with (friends)
- what you choose to give a f*ck about (what you let bother you)
- 
```
A better life starts with a better filter. Change who and what you allow into your world, and the peace will follow.

## [Naval's Startup](https://x.com/naval/status/1965472901760782366)

Fake news as usual. Better summary of what I actually said:

```

To understand human nature, read the older books. To develop specific knowledge, stay on the bleeding edge, read newer (technical) books.

The best authors - Deutsch, Schopenhauer, Borges, Ted Chiang - write with very high density. The best authors respect the reader’s time.

We live in an era of over sharing our personal lives. Yet I've found that making goals public creates a powerful, positive sense of accountability. It puts skin in the game. As I celebrate my 45th birthday today, these are the five core goals that will define my next chapter:

1) Heath & Fitness: Run a half marathon every year, summit a 6000m mountain, and improve sleep by optimizing my circadian rhythm.
2) Family Bonding: One international trip annually, a monthly date night, and a quarterly weekend getaway with my wife.
3) Business Leadership: Build a second-tier leadership team at Moneyworks4u.
4) Intellectual Pursuit: Master Python programming and learn one musical instrument.
5) Financial Milestone: Hit a nine-figure personal portfolio.

Most people in India don’t know this… but when you buy a new car in India the government actually owes you money back.

Yes, a refund. And it’s already linked to your PAN.

Whenever you buy a car above ₹10 lakh, the dealer collects 1% TCS.
So a ₹10L car → ₹10,000 TCS
A ₹30L SUV → ₹30,000 TCS
This money is YOURS. You can claim it.

How to get it back?
1️⃣ Ask your dealer for Form 27D right after purchase
2️⃣ Check your Form 26AS while filing ITR
3️⃣ Make sure the TCS is visible
4️⃣ Claim it as refund or adjust it against your tax

That’s it.
No trick. No hidden rule.
Just a benefit almost nobody talks about.

So if you’re buying a car 🚗 above ₹10 lakh
please don’t leave your money behind.
Take Form 27D… and take your refund too. 💰

Information like this saves people real money.

Rapido overtook Uber in monthly active users in India

SK Hynix overtook Samsung after 30 years to become the #1 DRAM maker globally (memory chips)

Nvidia overtook Intel and AMD in GPUs

In tech, aggression is the only moat; the biggest threat to tech is tech

Run fast and break things is the only thing that big tech needs to do; if you slow down, you're left behind!

when the first 22 years of your life the only goal was to get good marks and a degree

and now you’re 23 having no idea what to do next…

Peak Crisis.

Late marriage is cool because In early 30s you think that who will take responsibility of a family, kids and all, let's be with friends and enjoy the freedom. Friends are for forever, So you keep delaying the marriage.

But In early 40s when you see all of those friends are married now, have a beautiful family and kids, they're busy attending kids school's PTM instead of joining a party with you over weekend, 
you will realise that you've missed the bus and either you choose the wrong partner or people with broken marriage in FOMO or you will have to stay with loneliness.

That skill of ignoring your emotions and sticking to the plan is discipline. Here's how you can cultivate discipline:

![img_4.png](img_4.png)

```
One of the most valuable skills you can develop is the ability to ignore your emotions and stick with the plan.
```
```
Most people are at the mercy of their emotions which leads to them never achieving much.

Emotions come and go like waves.

You just have to withstand the lows --you’re not going to be in that “low” forever.

Once you do that, you’re no longer at the mercy of your emotions, making you disciplined.
```

just finished listening to the full 4h34m lex x pavel durov (telegram) podcast

if you have some time, it's a great listen

here were the main takeaways for me:

• health is wealth
• be active everyday
• freedom is more important than money
• in the past, we wanted to be the same as everyone to not starve, in this life, be different, master a niche, fight against human nature
• dont be average
• use your phone less (do not disturb)
• dedicate a lot of time to sleep
• define what YOU want to dedicate time and energy to, dont be reactive
• most information we consume is irrelevant to use
• taking action is the most important thing
• learn to stay calm in extreme situations
• fast (intermittent or 24 hours)
• use pain as signals to see what problems to fix
• ask yourself what are people's incentives
• creating systems > managing people
• in a business, stay lean

and this was just in the first 60 minutes, highly recommend the listen

im betting big on telegram
