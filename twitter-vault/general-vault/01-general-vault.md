[My Gurus](https://x.com/1shankarsharma/status/1943318848272261630)

I have admired, even revered üôè, just 3 people in life: Imran Khan, Muhammad Ali, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Business people & Investors are largely mediocre : one hit product, 1-2 lucky stock picks that made a lot of money. Almost no skill. Largely luck.
But sports? All skill.
My Gurus, as above, have had multiple acts: Immy: greatest all rounder after Sobers, philanthropist via Cancer hospital, politician; Ali: biggest comeback artist ever, after fighting US govt, winning back his crown in boxing old age.
Arnie: greatest bodybuilder ever. Superstar. Politician.

These are my Gurus. They have skill. Almost no enduring luck.

[Happiness and Focus](https://x.com/JEverettLearned/status/1940952313398808609)

Happiness is highly linked to how focused you are on what you're doing.

A wandering mind is an unhappy mind.

[What you want](https://x.com/thedankoe/status/1940098937521922213)

Life is hard because you don't know what you want. That's 90% of the battle. Once you have extreme clarity on what you want, after 5-10 calculated risks, everything else is quite simple. If you can reach that before you turn 25, you're in the top 1%.
