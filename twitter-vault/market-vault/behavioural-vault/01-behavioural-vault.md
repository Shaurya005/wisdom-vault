The Wrong Lessons of This Cycle That Investors Should 'Un-learn'

1. Stocks can't fall because there's so much money on the sidelines – SIP flows, FIIs, financial literacy, etc.

2. We'll hit $ XX trillion GDP, so buy stocks.

3. No need for debt, gold, or FDs – equities are the only game in town.

4. New-age themes and tech will change the world. Can't miss investing in them.

5. If the US Dollar Index falls, EMs will rise.

6. We don't need large caps – only SMIDs deliver alpha.

7. I can do it on my own.

And the most blatantly wrong one:

8. Valuations don't matter.
