[Long Term Investing](https://x.com/investorniti/status/1937081329822093519)

High and consistent dividend payout companies with no debt on balance sheet is the best bet for long term investment.

Two more additional points :-

No contingent liability and pledge by promoters will give confidence about good corporate governance.
-Regular Dividend payout without debt showing company are earning really without accounting manipulation,

since investor having less information about micro cap , these two points are most significant to watch.

Sectors and companies really beaten down due to just 1 quarter or one season‚Äôs bad performance can easily give 25‚Äì30% XIRR over 3 years. 
Funds have already started accumulating. Summer-related stocks are down due to a short summer.

Just imagine if you had picked agrochem and fert stocks after the bad monsoon 2 years ago many have delivered 30%+ XIRR with capex ready.
Just saying who are not active but works at peace.

Stanley Druckenmiller on his mentor, George Soros:
‚ÄúHe taught me to never invest in the present. Visalize 18 months out, that‚Äôs where the price will be.‚Äù

"Druckenmiller: What I actually learned is that position sizing is probably 70 to 80 per cent of the equation. It's not just about being right or wrong, it's about how much you make when you're right."

[Interesting Data by Devina Mehra](https://x.com/ActusDei/status/1893505478807752767)

Only 17 cos in the entire listed universe have grown their profits every year for the last 10 yrs. 
If you look at 20 yrs, only 1 company has done it. There's no alternative to having a portfolio (multiple bets) - you don't know what will work.

[Valuation Metrix](https://x.com/datta_arvind/status/1873765177369538642)

I would evaluate on two other metrics

2. Mcap to Sales.
2. Mcap to CFO

To get a better view if they are over valued or under valued
PE doesn't give the right measure of valuation

Screener P/E can mislead.
One big ‚Äòother income‚Äô & P/E looks cheap.
Exclude it & valuation doubles.
For examine Izmo

Sometimes P/E looks inflated due to one-off losses  but core business is strong.
Always check operating earnings, not just reported EPS

Any examples ?? üòä

[Style Drift in Investing](https://x.com/ishmohit1/status/1966561554100613369)

Late Night Learnings before going to sleep: Style Drift

Investors often get frustrated when their preferred style of investing stops working. This isn‚Äôt unusual‚Äîit‚Äôs something that happens across cycles.

Take bottoms-up investing for example-  An investor may identify multiple leaders in small caps showing strong PAT growth. This framework tends to work well over time. But there inevitably comes a phase when large caps‚Äîwith slower growth‚Äîstart outperforming, driven largely by flows and fund hoarding.

In such phases, I‚Äôve noticed many investors drift from their original style. They chase performance, even if it means buying companies at ‚Çπ3‚Äì4 lakh crore+ market caps‚Äîfar from where they began.

The reality is: bottoms-up investing comes with lumpy returns. Between 2018 and 2019, there was a 14-month stretch when many quality businesses moved sideways. Those same businesses became super-winners from late 2019 to 2021.

Yet, many who de-boarded the train during the lull never managed to get back on.

The lesson is simple‚Äîstick to your process of finding good businesses at reasonable valuations. As a retail investor, time is your biggest advantage. You don‚Äôt have to deal with institutional constraints or the pressure of publishing a NAV every day.

Avoid style drift. Stay flexible within your process. That discipline is what ultimately creates convexity in investing...
