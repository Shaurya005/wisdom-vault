[Long Term Investing](https://x.com/investorniti/status/1937081329822093519)

High and consistent dividend payout companies with no debt on balancesheet is the best bet for long term investment.

Two more additional points :-

No contingent liability and pledge by promoters will give confidence about good corporate governance.

-Regular Dividend payout without debt showing company are earning really without accounting manipulation,

since investor having less information about micro cap , these two points are most significant to watch.

[Beaten Down Sectors](https://x.com/SureshKBN/status/1954053211016359992)

Sectors and companies really beaten down due to just 1 quarter or one season‚Äôs bad performance can easily give 25‚Äì30% XIRR over 3 years. Funds have already started accumulating. Summer-related stocks are down due to a short summer.

Just imagine if you had picked agrochem and fert stocks after the bad monsoon 2 years ago many have delivered 30%+ XIRR with capex ready.

Just saying who are not active but works at peace.

Stanley Druckenmiller on his mentor, George Soros:

‚ÄúHe taught me to never invest in the present. Visualize 18 months out, that‚Äôs where the price will be.‚Äù

Building this edge, the ability to see ahead is the game.

Work!

"Always visualize where a company or market will be 18 months ahead, because stock prices reflect future expectations ‚Äì 'never, ever invest in the present... if you invest in the present, you‚Äôre going to get run over' Drunckenmiller

[Position Sizing](https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1952690739118571991)

"Druckenmiller: What I actually learned is that position sizing is probably 70 to 80 per cent of the equation. It's not just about being right or wrong, it's about how much you make when you're right."

90% problems of the retailers will get solved if they just start reading concalls of their portfolio companies and learn basic financial modeling and technical analysis.

[Multibagger Stock](https://x.com/ChanderBhatia01/status/1835916760580514265)

If you want 10,20 or 50 bagger stock-

Be ready for deep research, huge drawdowns, volatility, and holding period of one to two decades.

Life-changing outcomes don‚Äôt fall into your lap easily.

[Interesting Data by Devina Mehra](https://x.com/ActusDei/status/1893505478807752767)

Only 17 cos in the entire listed universe have grown their profits every year for the last 10 yrs. 
If you look at 20 yrs, only 1 company has done it. There's no alternative to having a portfolio (multiple bets) - you don't know what will work. 
Interesting study by @devinamehra

[Valuation Metrix](https://x.com/datta_arvind/status/1873765177369538642)

I would evaluate on two other metrics

2. Mcap to Sales.
2. Mcap to CFO

To get a better view if they are over valued or under valued
PE doesn't give the right measure of valuation
