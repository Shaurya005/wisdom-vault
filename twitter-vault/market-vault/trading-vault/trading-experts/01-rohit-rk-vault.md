#VVVTip

[Highly Liquid](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1931288884794753533)

Choosing just highly liquid leading stocks with very clean and linear moves, good attitude after each past breakout and belonging to the leading sector is the easiest way to become rich in swing trading in Indian Markets.

[Dan Zanger Quote](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1941047374173909299)

This single Quote from Dan Zanger Changed my life.

Dan Zanger turned 10k dollars to 18M in the fastest time.

I stopped sitting in stocks that broke out and spend days and weeks there, it should move the moment it breaks out.

Few understand this magic formula but those who do will do really well in Trading.

[IPO Flags](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1940813584407449767)

I generally like IPO Flags. IPO bases are good but IPO Flags give powerful moves if they work.

Just see BAJAJ INDEF - What a clean move - It had a mix of Institutional Buying + Young IPO Base.

SCODA TUBES - Powerful Young IPO Flag structure

[Maintain Equity Curve](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1940261276598641094)

To maintain an equity curve for your PF like a Stage 2 stock always you need 3 things.

Large Profits
Small Profits ( To cut with small losses)
Small Losses

Avoid - Large Losses.

That's how you maintain flag ranges after the push ups.

[Raging Bull Market](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1948645193609031865)

Trailing with moving averages alone works only for the Raging Bull Markets.

Indian markets have fooled or disguised traders in the last 4 years by acting textbook style with moves being longer and smoother making a false assumption in trader's minds that markets will remain like this forever.

The post Covid Era is just a period in Indian history of sporadic growth and excess liquidity flowing making things work really well. But to survive in this market being a trader for a very long time without getting emotionally tired one should definitely learn what works through periods of decades. We have done that research and knowing to adapt your selling is the most important thing that will help you survive in this markets for the longest period with the most clean equity curve.

[On My Wall](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1959849396985815236)

On my wall always since 3 years.

High Probability Trading

[Win Rate and Environment](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1958818358389842320)

The most important parameter for Swing trading for me is Win Rate and Environment

Even if a few stocks are doing 10-15% moves but that % win rate is too low. Im not trading such kind of markets.

I only want to play high win rate markets and environments. That's my game !


[Who I admire](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1958821658355278134)

A lot of you ask me, who is that one person who you respect a lot for their trading skill in twitter.

Only one man.
@KiranBhosale007


I have gone through almost everyone who is famous and I find no one having a verified PL success at all, just show a few trades here and there. No authenticity can be built. I really respect Kiran ji for the kind of returns he generated in the bull market. I have personally learnt from his trades and I find no one else who I can suggest to all of you as a super performance trader.

The one man I really respect very deeply and will be indebted to be connected to. No one else I feel has done such extraordinary performance that too in a verified way, people just talk big things, very less show proof of success !
