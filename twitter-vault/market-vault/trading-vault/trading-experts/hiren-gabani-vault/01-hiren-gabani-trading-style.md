[Stage Analysis](https://x.com/Hirengabani23/status/1945353308232933615)

✨ Stage analysis has proved a game changer for me.

✅Buying flag or bas in Stage-2: High chances of big move ( Stage -2 = Confirmation of institution accumulation)

✅Buy flags or base in Stage -3 or 1: High chances of breakout failures ( Stage 3 or 1 = Anticipation of institution accumulation)

✨This is the reason I always says: Don't buy anything blindly without context.

[Trade Clean Setup](https://x.com/Hirengabani23/status/1966720165661602068)

💫Smooth-moving and linear stocks chop you up less than choppy or slow-moving stocks.

✅Because if your stop-loss hits in a linear and smooth stock, it doesn't hurt much as you traded one of the best stock out there. But if it hits in a choppy stock, it hurts you both financially and mentally.

✅Be very, very selective. If you don't find a clean setup, don't trade. That's it.


[Not Trading Downside Bases](https://x.com/Hirengabani23/status/1965679961693729024)

💫The day I stopped trading downside bases, I began performing well in the market.

✅The goal isn't to buy at a low price, but to buy at the right price.

The basic premise of VCP is that supply is absorbed.

Beginners who focuses on patterns, indicators or setups can't have first principle thinking

VCP can't work in Stage-1 or Stage-4 stocks with huge overhead supply.

```
The basic criteria to avoid these stocks is 
1) 50 Ema > 200 Ema 
2) Price > 200 Ema

It helps me a lot
