💫My biggest edge in swing trading is Daily scanning.

⏩By scanning daily, I gain insights into:

✅Whether breakouts are working or not.   
✅Whether the rally is led by leaders or bottom bouncers.
✅Whether there is any leadership in the market.

⏩This is how I decide whether I should jump into the market or not.

✨Scan daily and train your eyes to find future leaders.
