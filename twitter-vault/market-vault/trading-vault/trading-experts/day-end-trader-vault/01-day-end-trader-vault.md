Moved to massive cash positions as breadth cracked.

Overall 1.5% Capital Lost

Loss making positions: TI, Hirect, ABSLAMC, JG Chem

Profitable positions: Exlerx, Gabriel, Nesco

Exited at or around cost: Vimta, Crizac, Nifty Futures

Notes:
Only 3 green days  post 14th August. After which the market tried going sideways but that has clearly not sustained.

Since the breadth has broken down before it barely got a lift I have booked profitable positions as well so as to protect them and lock in my drawdown.

How I study winning groups and capture superperformance (US version)

Although the current uptrend seems far from over it has been around 90 days since the tariff mayhem ended and the market breadth successfully recovered and gave the first buy signal on 23rd and 24th of April 2025.

Let's see what has happened since in different groups and compare it to the benchmark $SPY and $QQQ. FYI: I work with 90 group ETFs that are representative of clear industry groups and liquid enough to trade with ease.

Following are the returns in the past 90 days:
$SPY: 19.5%
$QQQ: 24.5%

It goes without saying that anything that has underperformed the above are clear laggards.
I'll go a step ahead and say anything underperforming the $QQQ can be discounted as well, even if it did outperform the $SPY.

So here goes...
