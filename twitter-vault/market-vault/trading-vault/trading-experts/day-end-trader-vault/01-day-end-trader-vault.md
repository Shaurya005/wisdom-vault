Moved to massive cash positions as breadth cracked.

Overall 1.5% Capital Lost

Loss making positions: TI, Hirect, ABSLAMC, JG Chem

Profitable positions: Exlerx, Gabriel, Nesco

Exited at or around cost: Vimta, Crizac, Nifty Futures

Notes:
Only 3 green days  post 14th August. After which the market tried going sideways but that has clearly not sustained.

Since the breadth has broken down before it barely got a lift I have booked profitable positions as well so as to protect them and lock in my drawdown.

How I study winning groups and capture superperformance (US version)

Although the current uptrend seems far from over it has been around 90 days since the tariff mayhem ended and the market breadth successfully recovered and gave the first buy signal on 23rd and 24th of April 2025.

Let's see what has happened since in different groups and compare it to the benchmark $SPY and $QQQ. FYI: I work with 90 group ETFs that are representative of clear industry groups and liquid enough to trade with ease.

Following are the returns in the past 90 days:
$SPY: 19.5%
$QQQ: 24.5%

It goes without saying that anything that has underperformed the above are clear laggards.
I'll go a step ahead and say anything underperforming the $QQQ can be discounted as well, even if it did outperform the $SPY.

So here goes...

[Wall of Brilliance](https://x.com/dayendtrader/status/1960716318254014581)

How to build 'A Wall of Brilliance' and weaponize your Twitter feed. A simple 2-step process.

Step 1: Ask yourself THE Question

Do some deep work on what kind of trader you 'are', or at least 'want to be'.

No matter what the answer is: Scalper, intraday, swing, position. You could be techno or funda or techno funda. You could be a momentum trader or a value investor etc etc etc.

Maybe you want to idolize the daily timeframe or maybe only look at weekly charts. Or maybe you don't look at charts at all. (Shrug...Sometimes I scare myself)

The style doesn't matter, the time frame doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that you are true to yourself.

Step 2: Listen to the Answer

Let's say, for the sake of this example, you decide to be a Breakout/Swing Trader who is only Techno and is most comfortable with the daily timeframe.

Once you have answered this question there is only one thing left to do. Only seek out experts who are doing the same. Unfollow everyone else!! Literally no other kind of trader/investor should exist on your timeline. Even a single page (if influential enough), that doesn't align with your style, will potentially have the power to sway you off your path.
DO NOT ENTERTAIN THEM.
DO NOT LET THEM LIVE RENT-FREE IN YOUR BRAIN.

Do it now. Do it today. There can't be a more auspicious day to start something new!

Build yourself a Wall of Brilliance. 🧠
