[Position Sizing Late In Trend](https://x.com/AmeetRai_/status/1947409884569604264)

Make sure your position sizing late in the trend is always smaller than what it would be early in the cycle.

A lot of traders mess this up — they go big when everything’s flying, thinking they’ve got the Midas touch, only to round-trip gains or worse.

Euphoria kicks in, the market feels “easy,” and they size up just as risk is actually increasing.

The right approach?

Size heavy early in the cycle when the risk/reward is most favorable.
Scale back late, when the gains have already played out and the easy money’s behind.

This is where traders who’ve made progress end up giving a big chunk back — not because their picks were bad, but because their sizing didn’t match the phase of the market.

So as we push deeper into this markup phase, be aware of where we are in the cycle.

Don’t confuse momentum for opportunity this late in the cycle.

The smart money was in early.
