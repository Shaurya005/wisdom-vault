Not all good earnings will have good charts

Not all bad earnings will have bad charts

It is for you to decide the level of headache you need in your life

[Price is right](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1936229630584988127)

You need to have your system.

Profit with labor is the bliss. Have a system that eliminates the names, and you independently analyze the rest and take a bet.

If there is a divergence between story and the price - the price is right


[Buying Dip](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1933365984007500001)

Free advise

If you want to buy the dips - switch to the weekly charts so you can see one higher swing low being made whenever a stock turns back up after the dip and you can buy it.

[Not Using RSI](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/19326344201646370660)

I don't use RSI.

If there are too many stocks meeting my criteria, firstly, there are not many that are immediately buyable as my criteria to look for in a chart is strict.

Smooth upmove and then some consolidation, OR long base, or some gap filling.

Out of these 12-15 setups - I come down to 7/8 and then buy the ones in the order of the breakout

[Selling Winners](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1932448173060165847)

Never sell your winner in one go if it is above your buy price

Sell in the parts

[Price Volume and Earnings](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1931294280208777473)

I still guarantee you that this is the only thing you need

Price, volume & earnings with a catalyst

You give this on platter to anyone & he/she will still need some more scanners & some more names.

The issue is not in the process but in the discipline. Thats why hardly a few succeed.

No one is here to learn the process but just interested in the stock names. :)

[Buyable List](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1931337683059568904)

First I run EPS scan. Looking for the stocks that have earnings or RS scan that has good technical charts

Then I see which one is immediately buyable and put that to the buyable list/focused list

Preference: Mcap = 1000-10000 cr
Sector/Industry - bunch of stocks tell me that

For instance in April 2nd week - GRSE, Cochin, Mazdock told me there is something in Defence

After that I read the basics of the business and finalise a few names

[What's Squat](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1940426112485736744)

Imagine the stock is in range of 96 to 100 for many weeks and it suddenly breaks above 100

Now, if it falls back below 100 without touching 96, and then recovers back to the upside, it is called as a squat

Squat is also called as hard pullback in technical analysis

If during even the base formation, the stock breaks below 96 and within a couple of days, come quickly back above that level on high volume, it is called as a shakeout

Shakeout are also called as bear traps in technical analysis by Sir Richard Schabacker in 1930s

They have been discussed by William Jiler as well in his book - “How chart patterns help you in the stock market”


[Squats and Risk Management](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1943166215612174756)

I buy a stock as it comes out from its base with a 10% position size keeping base low as SL

If it squats, I trim by half to protect the downside with SL for the rest of the half at the original base low.

If it squats and recovers later, I add back the sold half.

If it falls and hit the SL - I lose 0.5-0.7% per trade.

If it flies high in the air - I have a full 10% size.

[Catch Multibaggers](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1944205493590794284)

If you want to catch multi-baggers - you need just three scans:

EPS
Relative Strength
IPO stocks (listed within a year)

That’s it

More than this will create a lot of overlap with hardly a fewer uncommon names & a lot of confusion

Keep it simple

[Catch Multibaggers](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1943106863664632192)

Look for earnings surprise.
If you spotted suprise in the previous quarter - then look for the earnings acceleration.

[Clean Charts](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1940028757143593231)

Analyse clean charts if you are a beginner. Don't intend to draw anything. Price structure or you can say that the law of supply & demand is supreme.
