[List of Books](https://x.com/thechartist26/status/1951154138768875669)

Original account @_chartitude is hacked.

I am writing again the list of books that one should read as a beginner in trading/investing.
@InvestmentBook1 might share the link with you for them.

1. How I made 2,000,000$ in the Market by Nicolas Darvas - any cover you find on Amazon is ok. This book covers the basics, so you'll need to read it multiple times.
2. You can still make it in the market by Nicolas Darvas - here, he will explain in detail his concepts.
3. How to Make Money in Stocks - William O Neil
4. Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard by Mark Minervini
5. Thing and Trade Like a Champion by Mark Minervini
6. Secrets for Profiting in Bull & Bear Markets by Stan Weinstein
7. Two books on Jessie Livermore

Reminiscences of a Stock Operator
How to Trade in Stocks

In 2022 I wrote a blog on Substack mentioning all the books
