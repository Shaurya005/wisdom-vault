[Selling Winners](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1932448173060165847)

Never sell your winner in one go if it is above your buy price

Sell in the parts


[Beginner Trading Process](https://x.com/thechartist26/status/1976306856919241182)

If you are a complete beginner

Learn the zone of supply and demand equilibrium, which is often called as consolidation zone on the chart

Look for the stocks consolidating in a tight range

The consolidation range should be less than 5 to 6% and the stock should have a prior uptrend

Select the stocks that are close to their highs and from the strong sector

Buy the stock as it comes out of the consolidation zone by risking not more than 0.25% of your capital on a single trade

Place your stop loss near the consolidation zone low

Keep on repeating the process, till you are comfortable with it

You will fail miserably, if you end up, deciding how much the RBI will cut the rate or just in case you want to be the mediator in Russia-Ukraine war


[1/4 entry system](https://x.com/thechartist26/status/1975181925959823518)

For the stock that has not yet broken out, but I intend to take an entry based on anticipation - I buy 1/4 of the total position size that is permissible

The permissible position size is dependent on where I place the stop loss

If the SL is 4% deep, the maximum permissible position size is 25, so I will take 6.25% position size in anticipation

```
Please elaborate on your 1/4 entry system

[Buying Dip](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1933365984007500001)

Free advise

If you want to buy the dips - switch to the weekly charts so you can see one higher swing low being made whenever a stock turns back up after the dip and you can buy it.

[Not Using RSI](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/19326344201646370660)

I don't use RSI.

If there are too many stocks meeting my criteria, firstly, there are not many that are immediately buyable as my criteria to look for in a chart is strict.

Smooth upmove and then some consolidation, OR long base, or some gap filling.

Out of these 12-15 setups - I come down to 7/8 and then buy the ones in the order of the breakout
