⏩Trade smooth movers
⏩Trade stocks with solid volume action.

& Manage your risk well.

[Stage Analysis](https://x.com/Hirengabani23/status/1945353308232933615)

✨ Stage analysis has proved a game changer for me.

✅Buying flag or bas in Stage-2: High chances of big move ( Stage -2 = Confirmation of institution accumulation)

✅Buy flags or base in Stage -3 or 1: High chances of breakout failures ( Stage 3 or 1 = Anticipation of institution accumulation)

✨This is the reason I always says: Don't buy anything blindly without context.


[2-4 % Drawdowns](https://x.com/Hirengabani23/status/1946072354851110962)

✅If you start feeling uncomfortable by seeing 2-3% dd in your portfolio, mark my words, you're not gonna make big in this business.

✅2-4% drawdown is part of this business.

✅If you don't want big drawdowns, keep on trading with 0.1-0.2% of portfolio risk, where you do not make big nor lose big. But if you want good portfolio moves, you need to take calculated risk and press on gas in good market condition.

That's the truth.

[Daily Scanning](https://x.com/Hirengabani23/status/1953712141329920210)

💫My biggest edge in swing trading is Daily scanning.

⏩By scanning daily, I gain insights into:

✅Whether breakouts are working or not.   
✅Whether the rally is led by leaders or bottom bouncers.
✅Whether there is any leadership in the market.

⏩This is how I decide whether I should jump into the market or not.

✨Scan daily and train your eyes to find future leaders.
