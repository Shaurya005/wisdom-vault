Most traders treat every base the same.

But there's a BIG difference between a choppy base and a linear base. One leads to clean breakouts, the other traps you again and again.

Setups keep repeating. They were there 10 years ago, they are here now, and they will be there 10 years later too.
Market conditions may change, but patterns don‚Äôt.

So instead of jumping from one setup to another, just stick to one. Learn it inside out.
Especially when the market is slow or not offering much that‚Äôs the best time to sharpen your skills.

Because when the market heats up again, it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúnew setup‚Äù that will help you, it‚Äôs your old one practiced and perfected.

Q - How do I know if I‚Äôm chasing a stock too late?
It‚Äôs so hard to tell when it‚Äôs already gone up so much.

A - That‚Äôs where base analysis helps you see through the noise.

A stock doesn‚Äôt go up in a straight line  it runs, rests, then runs again. These resting zones are called bases. The first two bases usually come early in the trend that‚Äôs where the real money is made.

But by the time a stock is building its fourth base, it's already run a long marathon.

At base 1, institutions are loading.
At base 2, smart traders are still early.
Base 3 is where retail starts noticing.
By base 4 the crowd has arrived. The stock's been stretched, the growth‚Äôs priced in, and expectations are sky-high. Risk is no longer worth the reward.

People think they're buying momentum.
They‚Äôre actually buying exhaustion.

So Move on when you  find a stock at base 4.
It‚Äôs already had its party. Don‚Äôt be the guy who shows up when the DJ‚Äôs packing up.
