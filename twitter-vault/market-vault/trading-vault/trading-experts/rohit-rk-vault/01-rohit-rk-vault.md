[Net New Highs](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1965035190662861227)

The Net New Highs are breaking out from a range that has been there since the last 6 months.

The good times are coming.

![img_22.png](img_22.png)


## Trading Style

[Highly Liquid](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1931288884794753533)

Choosing just highly liquid leading stocks with very clean and linear moves, good attitude after each past breakout and belonging to the leading sector is the easiest way to become rich in swing trading in Indian Markets.

[IPO Flags](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1940813584407449767)

I generally like IPO Flags. IPO bases are good but IPO Flags give powerful moves if they work.

Just see BAJAJ INDEF - What a clean move - It had a mix of Institutional Buying + Young IPO Base.

SCODA TUBES - Powerful Young IPO Flag structure


[Maintain Equity Curve](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1940261276598641094)

To maintain an equity curve for your PF like a Stage 2 stock always you need 3 things.

Large Profits
Small Profits ( To cut with small losses)
Small Losses

Avoid - Large Losses.

That's how you maintain flag ranges after the push ups.

[Making Money in Market](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1939542785293492674)

3 Things can make you money in the market.

Institutional Buying.
IPO Bases.
Sectoral Bets.

[Win Rate and Environment](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1958818358389842320)

The most important parameter for Swing trading for me is Win Rate and Environment

Even if a few stocks are doing 10-15% moves but that % win rate is too low. Im not trading such kind of markets.

I only want to play high win rate markets and environments. That's my game !

[Losing small 10 times](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1971446845399310699)

This game is about losing small 10 times & Winning big 3-4 times.

Using a small stoploss let's you achieve the math behind super performance.

10 failed trades of 3% SL @ 10% PS costs you 3% of PF
3 Successful trades @ 10PS of 10% gain gets that back.

I'm calculating really low win rate of 3/13 win trades, the more you improve using selection criteria, the game keeps getting better !

This single Quote from Dan Zanger Changed my life.

Dan Zanger turned 10k dollars to 18M in the fastest time.

I stopped sitting in stocks that broke out and spend days and weeks there, it should move the moment it breaks out.

[Raging Bull Market](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1948645193609031865)

Trailing with moving averages alone works only for the Raging Bull Markets.

Indian markets have fooled or disguised traders in the last 4 years by acting textbook style with moves being longer and smoother making a false assumption in trader's minds that markets will remain like this forever.

The post Covid Era is just a period in Indian history of sporadic growth and excess liquidity flowing making things work really well. 
But to survive in this market being a trader for a very long time without getting emotionally tired one should definitely learn what works through periods of decades. 
We have done that research and knowing to adapt your selling is the most important thing that will help you survive in this markets for the longest period with the most clean equity curve.

[When to step out](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1947881931594473721)

Watchlists are red, Indices are cracking the 20MA and the stocks are doing fake breakouts.

Only experienced know to notice it and step out, the rest will keep trading such markets.

Know when to step out.




[Making and Keeping Money](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1947136953067155779)

The perfect recipe to making and keeping money in the stock market.

Knowing when to press the gas, and when to sit out sipping your tea is real knowledge.

A lot of you ask me, who is that one person who you respect a lot for their trading skill in twitter.

Only one man.
@KiranBhosale007


I have gone through almost everyone who is famous and I find no one having a verified PL success at all, just show a few trades here and there. No authenticity can be built. I really respect Kiran ji for the kind of returns he generated in the bull market. I have personally learnt from his trades and I find no one else who I can suggest to all of you as a super performance trader.

The one man I really respect very deeply and will be indebted to be connected to. No one else I feel has done such extraordinary performance that too in a verified way, people just talk big things, very less show proof of success !

Indices cracking below the 200MA today, was already just staying in cash since the last 45 + days majorly and I'm continuing to do the same.

Stock Market is a game of probability, not a game of fancy setups and breakouts.

If you are trying everyday, you really need to learn probability as a founding concept in Stock Trading

[Don't Read Too Many Books](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1966391998476411288)

To anyone asking me for resources to become a Champion Swing Trader - Here you go.

Don't read too many books and confuse yourself. Read Mark Minnervini & O Neil books. That's more than enough.

Then take all the winners of the Indian Market in the last 5 years and study every move in depth and take notes.

You will learn so much more from this activity rather than expanding your reading in books.


[Low Free Float Easily Manipulated](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1964943263724638520)

To the many talking about KIOCL, I absolutely will not touch such stocks. It feels fully manipulated to me all the time it breakouts.

It has a MCAP of 20000Cr. which makes people feel its a large stocks but it has a mere "200 Cr" Free float which is why it moves erratically when people post about it. 
That's a kind of stock that can be moved by a gang of retail and i feel Institutions dont even come there for long run,its just volume based entries and scalping

https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1969003753828163703
The answer is simple.

Do the same thing 1000 times.
I have traded the same setup probably 100's of times and you really know how to judge when things are working.

Fear the man who has practiced the same kick 1000 times. That's what I would suggest to everyone, practice one setup to excellence.

Rules and experience. Have been doing this everyday. This is my bread and butter setup - Institutional buying and IPO
```
How the hell you scale so well?

Are there some rules you follow before taking some more exposure?

Or it’s based on gut and a bit of your stocks in profit?
```


https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1968238662640132345

I'm in 100% Cash in a uptrend. You might feel I'm missing out on moves, but I don't think so.

Yes. I need feedback, I need many names to work smoothly and swiftly, without which I cannot trade confidently in large size, and conversely trading small sizes makes no impact on PF


https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1968238044479381617

Going home with 100% Cash. Absolutely weak markets that is definitely something I personally being a very aggressive momentum trader cannot trade. I need more push everywhere and more success rate %.

Tried to initiate a few small positions but there was no strength anywhere.

Had a loss of 47k ( <0.1% PF) Impact in those small attempts to initiate a position.

Absolutely no strength and failure of BO is all I can look at.

Closed the small left over Moschip also.


https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1968192572766966198

Focusing on just the names I had posted earlier the day. Not having a very broad list to focus as i cant concentrate and build large positions then.

For me everything is SIZING UP BIG with very SMALL RISK.

And even if one of the names work really well, Ill make a big push in PF


https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1968180762550865977

Another very highly liquid name that gave a recent entry out of the large base and now is in process of forming a very nice OTB setup here.

Disc: Not a buy/sell recomendation

The Complete Checklist apart from Indices that you should be considering to judge overall market conditions.

If you are looking at just the Indices moving up and starting to increase your exposure in this market, that wouldn't be prudent.

The Breadth is declining, thrust is missing, probability of stocks working is really low on D-1 and even if they do, the follow throughs are still missing. No sectoral pocket of strength is visible.

Make sure you also take feedback from recent trades about how the market is and how big is your executable watchlist. All of these matter a lot for performance

Our Valvo Sector Dashboards clearly signified today morning with leading positions for Defence in all our counters.

#1 in 20MA
#3 in 50MA
#1 in 200MA

The Verdict is clear for us. Very systematic, less opinions.

![img_16.png](img_16.png)


https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1966524858231349492

After a large Uptrend in the Mar-July period of 81%, the whole sector went through a regular pullback

You heard me right, the whole defence sector went up by almost 80% altogether and now seems like the next upmove is starting, Im positioned myself today with almost 25% in the Defence names with a tight stop.

Right when the SmallCap indices are looking like they are coming above the MA's, the defence sector as a whole is taking leadership. Something great to watch so far and if they all give the essential follow through, that's definitely something very positive as a sector as multiple upmoves will be possible in many names.

I made almost 60% of this year's profits from Defence rally in that season. It's always easy for me to play Liquid names that setup as a sector on a whole rather than individual names.

Disc: This is not a Buy/Sell Reco and is just for educational purposes.


![img_17.png](img_17.png)

Market Breadth is improving strongly even though the NNH has still not shown positive growth.

Defence seems to be the sector picking up steam with the smallcaps attempting to move above the KMA's

![img_18.png](img_18.png)

https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1966418136942731731

Stock trading is by far the hardest profession in town.

There is nothing called easy money, money here comes after putting years of hardwork with 10hr+ days learning and backtesting.

Never Ever leave your job to become a full time trader unless you reach a very big PF size.

Don't ever think of this as some easy side business, only if you are ready to put in so much hardwork, money can be made and only the most serious of traders can ever make money here.

It's a 2% winners game. Only 2% of traders make consistent money, be very careful

Also anything more than 20-25% is not possible every year in swing trading except the bull markets. So keep expectations in check always and no one can expect too high returns and if you do you will lose everything you have

https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1966062042357592442

The Probable reason Data based that can be attributed to why breakouts are not working well

With indices moving higher slowly, the NNH is going down, clearly which means that market health is bad but just masked by Indices

After spending 100s of hours studying all the past winners by simulating even the then present market environment & breakout success rates & generating super performance for the last 5 years consistently.

I can say one thing confidently.

You just need 2-5 weeks of extremely strong rally and breakout follow throughs to make all that you need for the year. Rest of the times just make sure your dabbling but never losing a lot. Keep the EC flat as long as possible for most part of the year and we can make a massive push in a small favourable period of the market which happens almost for a window of few weeks every year.

This is a lesson through my experience, so dont ever lose hope & you can make FY26 a massive performing year if you can wait patiently for that sweet easy money environment.
