## Trading Style

[Highly Liquid](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1931288884794753533)

Choosing just highly liquid leading stocks with very clean and linear moves, good attitude after each past breakout and belonging to the leading sector is the easiest way to become rich in swing trading in Indian Markets.

[IPO Flags](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1940813584407449767)

I generally like IPO Flags. IPO bases are good but IPO Flags give powerful moves if they work.

Just see BAJAJ INDEF - What a clean move - It had a mix of Institutional Buying + Young IPO Base.

SCODA TUBES - Powerful Young IPO Flag structure


[Maintain Equity Curve](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1940261276598641094)

To maintain an equity curve for your PF like a Stage 2 stock always you need 3 things.

Large Profits
Small Profits ( To cut with small losses)
Small Losses

Avoid - Large Losses.

That's how you maintain flag ranges after the push ups.

[Win Rate and Environment](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1958818358389842320)

The most important parameter for Swing trading for me is Win Rate and Environment

Even if a few stocks are doing 10-15% moves but that % win rate is too low. Im not trading such kind of markets.

I only want to play high win rate markets and environments. That's my game !

[Losing small 10 times](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1971446845399310699)

This game is about losing small 10 times & Winning big 3-4 times.

Using a small stoploss let's you achieve the math behind super performance.

10 failed trades of 3% SL @ 10% PS costs you 3% of PF
3 Successful trades @ 10PS of 10% gain gets that back.

I'm calculating really low win rate of 3/13 win trades, the more you improve using selection criteria, the game keeps getting better !
