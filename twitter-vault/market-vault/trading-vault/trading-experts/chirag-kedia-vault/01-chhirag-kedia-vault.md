Happy Teachers’ Day, @PradeepBonde!

As I’ve often said, you are among the finest teachers in trading, and truly one of the greatest of our times. 
I still remember going through your blogs from 2009–10 and wondering how advanced your thought process was even 15–20 years ago.

May the Almighty bless you with everything you wish for, along with a long life and good health, so you can continue guiding us through the dark.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart!❤️
