Choosing just highly liquid leading stocks with very clean and linear moves, good attitude after each past breakout and belonging to the leading sector is the easiest way to become rich in swing trading in Indian Markets.

[Dan Zanger Quote](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1941047374173909299)

This single Quote from Dan Zanger Changed my life.

Dan Zanger turned 10k dollars to 18M in the fastest time.

I stopped sitting in stocks that broke out and spend days and weeks there, it should move the moment it breaks out.

Few understand this magic formula but those who do will do really well in Trading.

[IPO Flags](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1940813584407449767)

I generally like IPO Flags. IPO bases are good but IPO Flags give powerful moves if they work.

Just see BAJAJ INDEF - What a clean move - It had a mix of Institutional Buying + Young IPO Base.

SCODA TUBES - Powerful Young IPO Flag structure

[Maintain Equity Curve](https://x.com/VVVStockAnalyst/status/1940261276598641094)

To maintain an equity curve for your PF like a Stage 2 stock always you need 3 things.

Large Profits
Small Profits ( To cut with small losses)
Small Losses

Avoid - Large Losses.

That's how you maintain flag ranges after the push ups.

⭐️ IPO TIP :

In a situation,
where multiple IPOs flock together,

in most of them, listing gains if any, will be limited, unless the IPO is a valuation bomb.

👉In such a case,
Keep track of all the good IPOs, listing with lesser gains or below expectation listing.

Out of those, within next 6-12 months,
At least 1-2 IPOs will give big breakout & might also double itself in the said duration.

SAVE IT and remember it.


[IPO Proceeds Use](https://x.com/investorniti/status/1944012134645436885)

If IPO proceeds,
are used for either...

🔸Debt Repayment or
🔸Capacity expansion

such IPOs are usually attractive by default.

👉 Analysis then falls back to:

🔸Nature of Business
🔸Management Plans
🔸Regulatory Support

If you can get the first two points spot on, you will rarely make mistake in IPO analysis because anyway, 3rd point is not in your hands.

(of course while keeping other things constant like financials, promoter background etc)

Save it.
Use it as a theme to analyse IPOs if you do.

The "Big money" is waiting for the Trade deal ✅

Without their presence, breakouts will fail, moves will be slow, markets will be choppy.

Don't lose your patience in this phase. Stay calm.

The game gets way easier once you start decoding price structures & spotting those Demand/Supply zones.

It’s no longer just Bars/ Candles on a chart, it’s a conversation between buyers and sellers.

Read it right and you are already ahead of the crowd.

[Play the Market Like Yourself](https://x.com/Anand_shah07/status/1945503416098173238)

The highest chance of consistent success in markets comes from making decisions aligned with your personality—not someone else’s playbook.
This may sound obvious. But in practice, it's incredibly rare.
Most investors don’t lose money because they’re wrong. They lose because they’re out of sync—with the market, with their process, and most importantly, with themselves.
They mimic others. They chase the “smart money.” They adopt strategies that look great on paper but feel terrible in practice. They try to be traders when they're wired to be investors. Or they hold through pain when their temperament screams for exits.
Eventually, something breaks.
Markets are ruthless amplifiers. They expose every crack in your emotional architecture. If you're not built for volatility, it will find you. If you hate being wrong, it will rub your face in it. If you’re drawn to excitement, it’ll tempt you into noise.
The only protection is fit.
You don’t need the best strategy. You need the one that fits your nature.
Are you methodical? Play long games.
Are you intuitive? Build around feel.
Are you impatient? Find faster cycles or stay out altogether.
Are you obsessive? Channel it into research, not revenge trades.
The market doesn’t reward cleverness. It rewards durability. And the only way to stay durable is to be at home in your own process.
So stop trying to win someone else’s game.
Play yours

[Swing Trading Indicators](https://x.com/ArindamPramnk/status/1944276292477800677)


My indicators are simple for swing trading😍:

1)Exponential Moving Average(20,50,100 and 200)
2)RSI
3)MACD
4)Volume Indicator

☝️I use multiple timeframes that gives me an edge for screening stocks for swing/momentum play and also long term play

💠Monthly and Weekly timeframe breakout is a must for selecting that stock for trade or long term purpose

☝️Here breakout means breaking out important or major resistance level in charts that has not been broken for years sometimes 5-10 years also

☝️Daily breakout confirms that it is ready in short term for entry

👉Keeping stoploss at 7-8% is a must in every swing trade
👉Medium term stoploss must be 15-20%
👉Long term stoploss 40-50%

💠Stocks generally takes time once stoploss hits to again continue rally so better to exit though your selection is good

[Market Doesn't Lie](https://x.com/markminervini/status/1943034662571348350)

The market doesn't lie. It speaks in price action. The problem is, depending on when and where you are in the market, the lauagauge can change. Context is everything. Nothing can be trusted in a vacuum or in perpetuity. Don't be fooled. Even timeless tactics require timing.

[Dan Zanger Quote](https://x.com/gauravvasshisht/status/1941280886076604582)


“I test the waters on a lot of stocks that break out, and I probably sell at least 50 percent of them either a minor gain or loss because they aren’t acting the way I want them to. It’s just like fishing — you never know when you’ll get a big fish on the line. One thing is certain — if you don’t step in and buy the stock on the breakout, you won’t have a chance to know what you’ve got. So I do a lot of fishing.” - Dan Zanger

I used to think watching the market all day  gave me more control but now I know it just gives me more time to lie to myself. give me six hours staring at the screen and I’ll turn any chart into a reason to buy or sell.
