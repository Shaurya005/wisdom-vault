[IPO Trading](https://x.com/investorniti/status/1937081329822093519)

⭐️ IPO TIP :

In a situation, where multiple IPOs flock together, in most of them, listing gains if any, will be limited, unless the IPO is a valuation bomb.

👉In such a case, Keep track of all the good IPOs, listing with lesser gains or below expectation listing.

Out of those, within next 6-12 months, At least 1-2 IPOs will give big breakout & might also double itself in the said duration.

SAVE IT and remember it.


[IPO Proceeds Use](https://x.com/investorniti/status/1944012134645436885)

If IPO proceeds, are used for either...

🔸Debt Repayment or
🔸Capacity expansion

such IPOs are usually attractive by default.

👉 Analysis then falls back to:

🔸Nature of Business
🔸Management Plans
🔸Regulatory Support

If you can get the first two points spot on, you will rarely make mistake in IPO analysis because anyway, 3rd point is not in your hands.

(of course while keeping other things constant like financials, promoter background etc)

Save it. Use it as a theme to analyse IPOs if you do.

The "Big money" is waiting for the Trade deal ✅

Without their presence, breakouts will fail, moves will be slow, markets will be choppy.

Don't lose your patience in this phase. Stay calm.

[VCP Pattern](https://x.com/chartians/status/1954565096358760926)

If you’re a swing trader stick to stocks that are following this pattern.

These are the ones most likely to lead the rally when the trend flips.

## [Anand Shah](https://x.com/Anand_shah07)
[Play the Market Like Yourself](https://x.com/Anand_shah07/status/1945503416098173238)

The highest chance of consistent success in markets comes from making decisions aligned with your personality—not someone else’s playbook.
This may sound obvious. But in practice, it's incredibly rare.
Most investors don’t lose money because they’re wrong. They lose because they’re out of sync—with the market, with their process, and most importantly, with themselves.
They mimic others. They chase the “smart money.” They adopt strategies that look great on paper but feel terrible in practice. They try to be traders when they're wired to be investors. Or they hold through pain when their temperament screams for exits.
Eventually, something breaks.
Markets are ruthless amplifiers. They expose every crack in your emotional architecture. If you're not built for volatility, it will find you. If you hate being wrong, it will rub your face in it. If you’re drawn to excitement, it’ll tempt you into noise.
The only protection is fit.
You don’t need the best strategy. You need the one that fits your nature.
Are you methodical? Play long games.
Are you intuitive? Build around feel.
Are you impatient? Find faster cycles or stay out altogether.
Are you obsessive? Channel it into research, not revenge trades.
The market doesn’t reward cleverness. It rewards durability. And the only way to stay durable is to be at home in your own process.
So stop trying to win someone else’s game.
Play yours

[Swing Trading Indicators](https://x.com/ArindamPramnk/status/1944276292477800677)


My indicators are simple for swing trading😍:

1)Exponential Moving Average(20,50,100 and 200)
2)RSI
3)MACD
4)Volume Indicator

☝️I use multiple timeframes that gives me an edge for screening stocks for swing/momentum play and also long term play

💠Monthly and Weekly timeframe breakout is a must for selecting that stock for trade or long term purpose

☝️Here breakout means breaking out important or major resistance level in charts that has not been broken for years sometimes 5-10 years also

☝️Daily breakout confirms that it is ready in short term for entry

👉Keeping stoploss at 7-8% is a must in every swing trade
👉Medium term stoploss must be 15-20%
👉Long term stoploss 40-50%

💠Stocks generally takes time once stoploss hits to again continue rally so better to exit though your selection is good

[Dan Zanger Quote](https://x.com/gauravvasshisht/status/1941280886076604582)

“I test the waters on a lot of stocks that break out, and I probably sell at least 50 percent of them either a minor gain or loss because they aren’t acting the way I want them to. 
It’s just like fishing — you never know when you’ll get a big fish on the line. One thing is certain — if you don’t step in and buy the stock on the breakout, you won’t have a chance to know what you’ve got. So I do a lot of fishing.” - Dan Zanger

[Last Week's Low](https://x.com/NickSchmidt_/status/1960518452604526809)

Last week felt like the beginning of a correction until Friday. The last 3 days have been so far positive action.

The more time we spend above last week’s lows increase the odds that it was just a shakeout. And shakeouts arent random, they happen before big rallies.

A lot of leaders have been stalling for the past few weeks which is why despite the indexes going up it’s been harder to make progress… and then we get a week like last week and the selling on top of the no progress makes you get defensive.

Most of the leaders have recovered in 3 days right back into their base and it can’t be ignored because the negative expectations (so far) has been broken.

If it was just a shakeout, then the leaders that we see with big hammer candles last week are coming up the right side of their base and getting ready to rally again.

[Reward-to-Risk and Win Rate](https://x.com/LoneStockTrader/status/1948084243982340274)

Important #trading insight:

I’ve reviewed my trades countless times, experimenting with tighter and tighter stops.

The win rate always drops—but the returns always go up, significantly.
That’s because the relationship between reward-to-risk and win rate isn’t linear.

What holds most people back from mind-blowing results is the lack of mental toughness to handle being wrong again and again… me included.

[Breaking Rules in Trading](https://x.com/VijayThk/status/1947955643018801530)

In Trading & Investing

📉 Breaking rules & losing = Good
📈 Breaking rules & profiting = Dangerous
Why?

Because profit after breaking rules feels rewarding.
But it trains your mind to repeat indiscipline.

In the long run, market should punish rule-breakers that’s healthy.

The greatest AHA moment of every losing trader who finally turned the corner?

It wasn’t better entries.
It wasn’t more discipline.
It was this:
“I was so obsessed with risk management... I ended up chasing low RS setups. The chronic under-performers, thinking they were 'safe'.”

In trying to avoid pain, they chose mediocrity.

As Merton said:
“The more you try to avoid suffering, the more you suffer, because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you in proportion to your fear of being hurt.”

Managing Risk in Bad Market Environments, or in Laggards and expecting to make money is the same as expecting to build a fit body by only doing Bicep Curls.

here is the real heirarchy:

[Index Death Cross](https://x.com/InvesysCapital/status/1877230246354665802)

A potential #DeathCross on the #Nifty500 Index is developing & worth watching

What is a Death Cross?

A Death Cross occurs when the 50-day moving average (DMA) crosses below the 200-day moving average (DMA).

On weekly charts, it's the 10-week moving average (WMA) crossing below the 40-week WMA.

Historically, it has marked the transition from a bull market to a bear market

Key Observations from History
When it Matters: Particularly impactful after a strong overbought bull run.

Outcomes: Such events led to long correction or consolidation phases, lasting anywhere from 37 weeks to 88 weeks.

Exception: The only failure occurred in 2006, when markets continued their uptrend despite the signal.

If the Death Cross is triggered investors should prepare for potential market headwinds.

[Francesco](https://x.com/FranVezz/status/1966591027160002851)

In his @chatwithtraders interview, @Qullamaggie said he grew tired day trading because you're always so close to the danger point - your entry, and your stop.

He loved the freedom of not being at the screen all day, watching every tick. Building cushion, trimming, trailing.

I started as a day trader an experienced the exact same evolution. To me, this is the beauty of being a swing trader.

Took mom to lunch today with my wife and son. Living life, whilst doing what I love. Priceless.

[Jeff Sun, CFTe](https://x.com/jfsrev/status/1966511757910032579)

If you’ve accepted that your win rate will often be below 35% in most months, the only way to consistently finish positive on those months is by having a non-discretionary sell rule to hold onto your winning trades for as long as possible, while also cutting losing trades within a limited -R as soon as possible.

Be patient with the factor of time on winning trades that are very far from your average price. Remember, a chart has both a y-axis and an x-axis, don't be fixated on wanting the upward price movement every single day, it doesn't happen, at least most of the time.

You can always sell some into strength to cushion the anxiety of any potential unrealized profit loss, that's the most beautiful thing about holding them.

```
Buying is relatively easy because you can find tight spots to manage risk, selling into strength is slightly tough but doable as you can sell some at multiple of your R like 2,3,4 
but holding a piece for larger move and trusting extensions or 10MA rule , now that's a whole another level of skill - not conceptually but emotionally cause you see your open P/L, you are feeling excited, 
you are anxious you don't want to give back too much, but this is where you make up for 10-25 losses at once or more , just by trusting the process - TY for sharing in real time Jeff!

This creates a dynamic zone — not just a single line — that helps me visualize trend, momentum, and risk. It gives enough room for natural volatility, while still keeping me anchored to the trend.

People greatly overweight costs that are:
explicit | certain | now.

People greatly underweight costs that are:
implicit | uncertain | later

```
The other question is to ask: What are the hidden costs of not paying for something?

No gym membership/exercise -> chronic health issues and doctor/drug costs later on

Don't buy books/courses/education -> miss out on all the upside more skills you would have gotten
