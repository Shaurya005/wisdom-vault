[IPO Trading](https://x.com/investorniti/status/1937081329822093519)

‚≠êÔ∏è IPO TIP :

In a situation,
where multiple IPOs flock together,

in most of them, listing gains if any, will be limited, unless the IPO is a valuation bomb.

üëâIn such a case,
Keep track of all the good IPOs, listing with lesser gains or below expectation listing.

Out of those, within next 6-12 months,
At least 1-2 IPOs will give big breakout & might also double itself in the said duration.

SAVE IT and remember it.

Not all good earnings will have good charts

Not all bad earnings will have bad charts

It is for you to decide the level of headache you need in your life

[Price is right](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1936229630584988127)

You need to have your system.

Profit with labor is the bliss. Have a system that eliminates the names, and you independently analyze the rest and take a bet.

If there is a divergence between story and the price - the price is right


[Buying Dip](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1933365984007500001)

Free advise

If you want to buy the dips - switch to the weekly charts so you can see one higher swing low being made whenever a stock turns back up after the dip and you can buy it.

[Not Using RSI](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/19326344201646370660)

I don't use RSI.

If there are too many stocks meeting my criteria, firstly, there are not many that are immediately buyable as my criteria to look for in a chart is strict.

Smooth upmove and then some consolidation, OR long base, or some gap filling.

Out of these 12-15 setups - I come down to 7/8 and then buy the ones in the order of the breakout

[Selling Winners](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1932448173060165847)

Never sell your winner in one go if it is above your buy price

Sell in the parts

[Price Volume and Earnings](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1931294280208777473)

I still guarantee you that this is the only thing you need

Price, volume & earnings with a catalyst

You give this on platter to anyone & he/she will still need some more scanners & some more names.

The issue is not in the process but in the discipline. Thats why hardly a few succeed.

No one is here to learn the process but just interested in the stock names. :)

[Buyable List](https://x.com/_chartitude/status/1931337683059568904)

First I run EPS scan. Looking for the stocks that have earnings or RS scan that has good technical charts

Then I see which one is immediately buyable and put that to the buyable list/focused list

Preference: Mcap = 1000-10000 cr
Sector/Industry - bunch of stocks tell me that

For instance in April 2nd week - GRSE, Cochin, Mazdock told me there is something in Defence

After that I read the basics of the business and finalise a few names

#Protip #Stocks

Look or stocks not breaking 2 days low.
Looks for stocks that are closing in 2%[+/-] range.

Once the market settles - they will lift off üíö

[Demand/Supply zones](https://x.com/StocksNerd/status/1933029111561130200)

The game gets way easier once you start decoding price structures & spotting those Demand/Supply zones.

It‚Äôs no longer just Bars/ Candles on a chart, it‚Äôs a conversation between buyers and sellers.

Read it right and you are already ahead of the crowd.
