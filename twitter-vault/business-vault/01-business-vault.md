Core Web Vitals should matter to not just SEO experts, but anyone interested in scaling D2C

Often your product is great, and your ads are getting people to your site, but good chunk of them bounce before even seeing the second image

Or worse, your D2C site ranks below third-rate aggregators on Google despite having a better brand, better product, and better reviews on keywords you should own

One big reason could be that your site experience sucks.

And that’s exactly what Core Web Vitals is trying to measure.

These aren’t vanity metrics. They’re Google’s way of telling you that your user experience is frustrating. And we won’t reward it with visibility

Here’s what Core Web Vitals actually mean (without jargon):

•LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) = How long your main visual/image takes to load. If it’s >2.5s, it’s a problem

•CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) = Does the screen jump around while loading? If buttons shift while the user tries to click, it’s hurting conversions

•INP (Interaction to Next Paint) = How fast your site reacts to taps/clicks. If there’s a delay when they hit “Add to Cart”-bad news.

Think of it this way:

•LCP = First impression
•CLS = Does the page feel stable?
•INP = Is it snappy?

Why should founders/CMOs care?

Because these metrics directly affect 3 things:

1. Organic traffic (SEO): Google demotes slow and clunky sites. Doesn’t matter how good your content or backlinks are

2. Conversion rate: People bounce when images load late, or buttons move as they click

3. Ad ROAS: Your performance marketing team is paying to drive traffic to a broken experience. You lose money before the user even evaluates the product

How to check your Core Web Vitals:

Free Tools:

•PageSpeed Insights
•Lighthouse

Ideal Benchmarks in my opinion:

•LCP < 2.5s
•CLS < 0.1
•INP < 200ms

If you are doing everything else right- good products, good marketing, good creatives etc, don’t let slow LCP and messy CLS undo your good work
